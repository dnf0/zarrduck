Task 1 implements the synthetic data generator: a tiled COG GeoTIFF plus

contender tools (eider/DuckDB, exactextract, rasterstats).

    geometry construction is not repeated per query). It is created with
    ``CREATE OR REPLACE`` so repeated calls never accumulate multiple 4M-row
    tables in memory.

    Columns: ``x, y, v`` (cell CENTRE coords + value) plus the precomputed
    geometry columns ``pt`` (``ST_Point`` of the centre) and ``box``
    (``ST_MakeEnvelope`` of the cell). Bare-column predicates against ``pt`` /
    ``box`` let the spatial-join optimiser engage.

    The WHERE on x/y prunes the read to the polygons' neighbourhood (read_geo's
    lat/lon bbox pushdown does not apply to EPSG:3857 COGs, whose dims are y/x).

    Half-pixel correction: ``read_geo`` reports each cell's UPPER-LEFT CORNER,
    not its centre (verified empirically: a 30 m grid with origin x0=0 yields
    read_geo x = 0, 30, 60 ... whereas the true cell centres are 15, 45, 75 ...
    = x + dx/2; and read_geo y = -1470, -1440 ... whereas the true centres are

    downward). All downstream predicates (the ST_Point centroid test, the
    cell-box envelope, the index-join snap) assume CENTRES, so we shift the raw
    corner coords to centres here. Without this shift the cell boxes are offset
    by half a pixel and MAX/centroid selection picks the wrong cell.
